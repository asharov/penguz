# Copy this file to local_settings.py and add any necessary local
# settings here. You will want to set at least the DATABASES and
# SECRET_KEY settings, and probably some others too.

# Add only the settings you want to change from the defaults in
# settings.py. Anything in this file will override any setting from
# settings.py.
