    Enter your information here. Your username and password are used
    to log in to the site. Your name and nationality will be displayed
    in the results table of the contests that you participate in, but
    neither is mandatory. Nationality is used to determine the proper
    results for contests such as national championships, so it should
    be the country you would represent at world championships. If you
    do not provide them, your username is used in place of your name,
    and your nationality is not displayed, Your email address will not
    be publicly visible, but it will be shown to the organizer of any
    contest you participate in, to enable them to contact you
    afterwards.
