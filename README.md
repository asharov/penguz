Penguz
======

Penguz is a Django app for running Web-based contests of a specific
type. It is primarily intended for puzzle contests similar to those
run by Logic Masters India and other World Puzzle Federation member
organizations, but can in theory be used for non-puzzle contests that
share a similar structure.

At the moment Penguz is still very much in development, so don't start
using it yet. It's also a way for me to learn making sites with
Django, so I won't be accepting contributions until I've managed to do
most of the things I currently have planned.
